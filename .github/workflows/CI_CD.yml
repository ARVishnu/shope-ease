      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (required for React)

        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies

      # Step 4: Build the React app
      - name: Build React app
        run: npm run build # This creates the optimized production build in the `build/` folder
